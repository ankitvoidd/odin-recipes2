    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
    <li>Drain and lay the noodles out on a baking sheet or parchment paper to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, and parsley. Mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
