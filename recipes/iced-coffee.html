    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Iced coffee is a chilled, invigorating beverage made by brewing coffee and then cooling it over ice. It offers a refreshing alternative to hot coffee, with a smooth, bold flavor that's often enhanced by a splash of milk or cream and a touch of sweetener. Perfect for a warm day, iced coffee delivers a crisp, energizing kick while keeping you cool.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) brewed coffee (hot or cold)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) milk or cream (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons sugar or sweetener (to taste)</li>
        <li>Ice cubes</li>
        <li>Optional: flavored syrups or extracts (e.g., vanilla, caramel)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brew 1 cup of your favorite coffee. You can use a coffee maker, French press, or any preferred method. If youâ€™re using hot coffee, allow it to cool slightly before proceeding.</li>
        <li>While the coffee is still warm, stir in 1-2 tablespoons of sugar or sweetener, depending on your taste. This helps the sweetener dissolve better.</li>
        <li>Let the coffee cool to room temperature, or place it in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process.</li>
        <li> Fill a glass with ice cubes.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooled coffee over the ice. Add milk or cream to taste, stirring gently to combine. If you prefer a flavored iced coffee, you can also add a splash of flavored syrup or a few drops of extract at this stage.</li>
        <li>Stir the coffee well and serve immediately. Enjoy your refreshing iced coffee!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Feel free to adjust the milk and sweetener amounts according to your preference. You can also experiment with different types of milk or non-dairy alternatives for a personalized touch!</p>
