        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan to form the crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Gradually add sugar and vanilla extract, beating until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, beating on low speed after each addition until just combined.</li>
        <li>Mix in sour cream and heavy cream until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over the cooled crust in the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly. The edges should be firm and slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and crack the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After cooling, remove the cheesecake from the oven and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to fully set.</li>
        <li>Before serving, top with fresh fruit, fruit sauce, or chocolate ganache if desired.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and slice to serve.</li>
